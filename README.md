# Automatic-Sanitizer
In the time of pandemic, it has been important to every one to take care of themselves.  In this process, sanitization is the most crucial thing which one person has to follow. To make the sanitization very easy and also touchless I came up with the idea of automatic sanitizer. This automatic sanitizer consists of an ultrasonic sensor which calculates the distance and depending on the result it will activate the servo motor that compresses the sanitizer bottle to push out the sanitizer liquid. This is completely touch free and also easy to operate
